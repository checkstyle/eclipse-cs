    <h1>Providing custom Checkstyle checks</h1>
    <p> One great feature of Checkstyle is its extensibility. You can easily write own checks as explained <a
            target="_blank" href="https://checkstyle.org/writingchecks.html">here <i
                class="fa fa-external-link"> </i></a> . <br/> To hook your checks into the eclipse-cs plugin you need to
        provide them as a extension plugin. </p>
    <p> In the further steps I am - for the sake of simplicity - assuming that you start off with the <a
            href="#!/extensions">sample plugin</a> the eclipse-cs project provides. <br/> If not then you are supposedly
        proficient enough with eclipse plugin development that you figure on your own.</p>
    <p>If done correctly, you even will be able to use your plugin jar file for adding your custom checks to a
        Checkstyle Ant/Maven/CmdLine target - without the need for further modification.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Write your custom checks, putting them in your extension projects source folder</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Edit the <code>checkstyle_packages.xml</code> and add the Java package(s) where your custom checks
                reside there. <br/> In doing so you will be able to define your checks in your configuration file using
                the logical check name - instead of needing to provide the fully qualified class name of your check.
                <br/> For more info about the checkstyle packages files please read here: <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://checkstyle.org/config.html#Packages"
                    >https://checkstyle.org/config.html#Packages <i class="fa fa-external-link"> </i></a>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Create a plugin.xml in your project root and declare the plugin providing checkstyle addons: <br/>
                <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;?eclipse version="3.1"?&gt;
&lt;plugin&gt;
        &lt;!-- This plugin provides custom Checkstyle modules. --&gt;
        &lt;extension point="net.sf.eclipsecs.core.checkstyleAddonProvider" /&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</code></pre>
                <strong>Note:</strong>Before eclipse-cs 5.6.0 is was necessarily for the extension plugin to configure
                buddy-classloading, this restriction is not necessary anymore with the approach above. <br/> Entry in
                    <code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> : <br/>
                <code>Eclipse-RegisterBuddy: net.sf.eclipsecs.core</code>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> (Optional) Provide metadata for your custom checks. <br/> By providing metadata your checks will
                facilitate the full capabilities of the plug-ins configuration editor - this means you will be able to
                configure them using the plug-in's configuration editor just like the standard checkstyle modules. <br/>
                To define the metadata you need to write a file named <code>checkstyle-metadata.xml</code> which is to
                be placed into the package (or packages) your check classed lie in. <br/>
                <strong> In order to let the plug-in find your metadata you need to declare the package within your
                        <code>checkstyle_packages.xml</code> file (see point 2). </strong>
                <br/> The metadata file must adhere to this dtd: <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/dtds/checkstyle-metadata_1_1.dtd"
                    >http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/dtds/checkstyle-metadata_1_1.dtd</a> . <br/> So it would be a
                good idea to include this document type declaration to your metadata file: </p>
            <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE checkstyle-metadata
    PUBLIC &quot;-//eclipse-cs//DTD Check Metadata 1.1//EN&quot;
    &quot;http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/dtds/checkstyle-metadata_1_1.dtd&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>This way you can validate your metadata file against the dtd using your preferred XML editor.</p>
            <p> The dtd file itself contains an abundance of documentation on the tags and their attributes, further
                further practical reference you may want to peek into the <code>net.sf.eclipsecs.checkstyle</code>
                plugin, where all the metadata for the standard Checkstyle modules resides. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p> If you provided custom metadata for your checks you will be able to fully configure them using the
                plug-in's configuration editor, after you installed your plugin into your Eclipse. <br/> If you did not
                provide custom metadata some limitations in the configuration editor will apply: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p> You cannot add your custom checks via the configuration editor, because your checks are not
                        known to the plugin. <br/> This means you need to write your checkstyle configuration file by
                        hand using a text editor. Be sure to include all properties of your modules within the module
                        configuration so you can at least edit the properties afterwards in the Checkstyle Plug-in
                        Configuration Editor. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If you remove your custom checks from the configuration using the configuration editor you cannot
                        re-add them using the configuration editor.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> Your hand added custom checks will show up in the <i>Other</i> section of the configuration
                        editor. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
