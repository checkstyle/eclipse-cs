    <h1>Restrict Checkstyle validation using project filters</h1>
    <p>The Eclipse Checkstyle Plugin contains a filter facility to exclude certain files from Checkstyle. <br/> Knowing
        that the plug-in allows you to configure file sets you might ask why there are also filters. <br/> This feature
        seems to be quite redundant to file sets.</p>
    <p>Lets think about this some more. <br/> File set let you configure patterns that determine if a file gets included
        or excluded from the checks based on the file name. <br/> In some situations this is quite sufficient but there
        are also cases where you want to exclude files based on other properties, for instance if you want to exclude
        files that are write protected. <br/>
    </p>
    <p>The filters are accessible in the bottom section of the Checkstyle Project Properties Page.</p>
    <p><img src="images/properties_simple_checked.png" alt="project filters"/>
        <br/> To enable a filter for your project just select the corresponding check box. <br/> Some filters are
        configurable, if you select such a filter the <i>Change...</i> button will become enabled. <br/> Pressing the
            <em>Change...</em> button will open a specific filter editor.</p>
    <p>The following filters come with the plugin:</p>

    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Filter</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Files outside source directories</td>
                <td>This filter is enabled by default. Some projects have java sources outside of source folders (for
                    instance build folders where all sources are copied to for source distribution builds). <br/> With
                    this filter you can exclude this files from the checks. Again, this can be also achieved by <a
                        href="#!/filesets">configuring file sets</a> - but for most cases the filter is easier to
                    use.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Write protected files</td>
                <td>Use this filter if you want to check only writeable files. This filter is particular useful if you
                    use a versioning system with a Check-In/Check-Out semantic which uses file write protection to
                    allow/disallow modification. <br/> So you can restrict the Checkstyle Plug-in to only check files
                    you are actually working on (because you checked them out from the repository).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Derived (generated) files</td>
                <td>Excludes project resources which have the <em>Derived</em> flag set, which is typically the case for
                    generated sources.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Files not opened in editor</td>
                <td>You can use this filter to check only files you opened in an Eclipse editor. This is particularly
                    useful for big projects, as checking all files might lead to unacceptable build times or resource
                    consumption.<br/>If this filter is enabled a project file which is opened in the editor is
                    automatically checked upon opening, pointing out the problems in this file. Likewise when the file
                    is closed the associated problem markers are cleared from the Problems view.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Files from packages</td>
                <td>This is a configurable filter, allowing you to specify the packages you want to exclude from
                    checking. You can, of course, get the same result by <a href="#!/filesets">configuring file sets</a>,
                    but this variant is much more practical.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Files in sync with the source repository</td>
                <td>If your project is based on a source repository (Git, SVN, CVS) you might want to use this filter.
                    <br/>With this you can limit the checks to the files you actually changed. All other files that are
                    in sync with the repository (therefore unchanged) are excluded from the checks.<br/>This filter is a
                    great way to support the application of the <a target="_blank"

                        found it.</em>) within your development team.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Files older than one day</td>
                <td>Excludes all files with a modified/created timestamp older than one day. This allows you to focus
                    on files that changed recently, and to easily ignore issues that exist already since a long time.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>

    <p>The Eclipse Checkstyle Plugin provides an extension point for custom filters which can be used to implement
        your own filter. Read <a href="#!/custom-filters">here</a> for more info about <a href="#!/custom-filters"
