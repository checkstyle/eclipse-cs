        <h2>-- Configuration types --</h2>
        <p>Since the 4.0.0 release the Checkstyle Plug-in uses plain Checkstyle configuration files.
            For easier reuse of existing Checkstyle configurations and to support some common use
            cases different Configuration types were introduced into the plug-in. The following
            section explains the existing configuration types:</p>
        <h3>Built-in Configuration</h3>
        <p><a id="Builtin"> </a>Built-in configurations come shipped with the plug-in (or an
            extending fragment). They can not be edited nor deleted. <br></br> You can create an own
            configuration based on a built-in (or any other) configuration by copying the
            configuration. <br></br>Built-in configurations cannot be created by the user but can be
            added through a fragment which extends the plugin. <br></br>Please read <a
                href="extending_builtin_configurations.html">here</a> for more info.</p>
        <h3>Internal Configuration</h3>
        <p><a id="Internal"> </a>Internal configurations are stored within the Eclipse metadata. Use
            an internal configuration if you don&#39;t want to manage the location of your
            configuration by yourself. <br></br><img src="images/new_internal_config.jpg"
                alt="Internal Configuration"></img><br></br> You need to provide a unique name for
            the configuration, the plugin will generate a file name on its own and store the
            configuration file within the plugins state location inside the workspace.</p>
        <p>An existing Checkstyle configuration file can be imported into the internal configuration
            by using the <em>Import...</em> button. Note that this will overwrite the existing setup
            for this configuration.<br></br>If you ever need the configuration file outside the
            plug-in use the export functionality.</p>
        <p>Internal configurations can be edited and deleted (which will also delete the Checkstyle
            configuration file).</p>
        <h3>External Configuration</h3>
        <p><a id="External"> </a>Use this configuration type if you have a Checkstyle configuration
            file outside of an Eclipse workspace in your file system. <br></br> The External
            Configuration just points to this configuration file and uses it from its location.
                <br></br><img src="images/new_external_config.jpg" alt="External Configuration"
            ></img><br></br> You need to provide a unique name for the configuration together with
            the full absolute path to the Checkstyle configuration file.<br></br>Relative paths are
            not supported, but there is support to make the absolut path a bit dynamic to allow
            differing absolute paths on multiple developer machines.<br></br>To do this use
                <em>${property}</em> style pattern(s) in the location string, these patterns will be
            resolved from equally named Classpath Variables or Environment properties (passed into
            Eclipse via -D parameter). </p>
        <p>External configurations can by default be edited if the configuration file is
            writable.<br></br>If you have a carefully crafted configuration file (with nice comments
            and all that) - which you don't want to "destroy" accidently by using the configuration
            editor - you can use the <em>Protect Checkstyle configuration file</em>
            option.<br></br>When enabled the configuration editor will not touch your file even if
            it is write enabled.<br></br> If you delete an External Configuration from the plug-in
            the external configuration file will <strong>not</strong> be deleted.</p>
        <h3>Remote Configuration</h3>
        <p><a id="Remote"> </a>This configuration type can be used if you want to publish your
            Checkstyle configuration on a web server and have all developer in your company use it.
                <br></br><img src="images/new_remote_config.jpg" alt="Remote Configuration"
            ></img><br></br>As usual a unique name must be provided together with the URL of the
            Checkstyle configuration file.<br></br>If the webserver requires HTTP basic
            authentication a popup dialog will request the credentials input.<br></br>Optionally you
            can let the plugin store the password, which will be stored in the Eclipse
            keyring.<br></br>While this offers a reasonable level of security it is not impossible
            to crack.</p>
        <p>For the travelling consultants out there - the <em>Cache configuration file</em> option
            is for you.<br></br>When your company has deployed the Checkstyle configuration file on
            an internal server which is of course not reachable when away at a customers site, using
            this option will tell the plugin to cache the configuration file once it is
            reachable.<br></br>When the configured location is not reachable anymore the plugin will
            use the cached configuration file.<br></br>This allows you to use the same Checkstyle
            configuration On- and Offsite.</p>
        <p>A Remote Configuration can not be edited but can be removed from the plug-in.</p>
        <h3>Project Relative Configuration (behaviour changed in 4.1.0)</h3>
        <p><a id="Project"> </a>If you have your Checkstyle configuration file inside a project in
            your workspace the easiest thing is to use the Project Relative Configuration.<br></br>
            <img src="images/new_project_config.jpg" alt="Project Relative Configuration"
            ></img><br></br> Like always a unique name must be provided along with the relative path
            consisting of <em>project-name/relative-path-in-project</em>.<br></br> Using the
                <em>Browse...</em> button you can easily select the configuration file from a
            project.</p>
        <p>A Project Relative configuration can be edited using the Configuration Editor when the
            configuration file is writable. <br></br>Like with External Configuration type the
            configuration file can be protected from accidently rewriting it with the Configuration
            Editor.<br></br>When a Project Relative configuration is deleted the Checkstyle
            configuration file remains untouched.</p>
