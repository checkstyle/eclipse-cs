            the mailing list or enter a bug report.</p>
        <p><b>Q: <br/>
            </b>I am getting error markers on all my files which saying:<br/>Unable to get class
            information for XYZ<br/>How to get rid of them?</p>
        <p><b>A: <br/>
            </b>If you are using RAD 6/7 or run Eclipse on IBMs J9 VM please read <a
                href="rad_usage.html">here</a>.<br/>In other cases modify your Checkstyle
            configuration file, setting the <b>logLoadErrors</b> property of the
            <b>JavadocMethod</b> and <b>RedundantThrows</b> check to <em>true</em>. You can do this
            via the plugins Configuration editor (recommended) or manually be adding the property to
            your Checkstyle configuration XML file(s).</p>
        <hr/>
        <p><b>Q:</b>
            <br/> I just dropped plug-in version x.x.x in Eclipse (replacing version z.z.z, which
            was working great) and I&#39;m having some trouble using it. <br/> When I go to
            Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Checkstyle an error occurs.<br/> I looked into the
            Eclipse error log and found some NoClassDefFoundExceptions. Whats going on? </p>
        <p><b>A:</b>
            <br/> If you install the plug-in from the downloaded distributable (not via the Update
            Site) over an older version of the plug-in, Eclipse may have difficulties detecting the
            change and updating its cached information about the plug-in. <br/> To force Eclipse to
            update this information you have to restart Eclipse with the <span class="code-blue"
                >-clean</span> option. <br/> For instance: <span class="code-blue"
                >&lt;path-to-my-eclipse&gt;\eclipse.exe -clean</span></p>
        <hr/>
        <p><b>Q: <br/>
            </b> I wrote a new Checkstyle rule. I know it works because I tested it. I created a
            .jar file with .class files and with messages.properties. <br/> I can&#39;t plug-in
            my rule to Eclipse - i don&#39;t know how do it ?</p>
        <p><b>A: <br/>
            </b> It is now documented what to do to integrate custom checks with the plug-in. See <a
                href="extending_custom_checks.html">here</a> .</p>
        <hr/>
        <p><b>Q:</b>
            <br/> I use the Checkstyle Plug-in with my project which has only 1.000.000 source
            files. <br/> Using Checkstyle on this project is extremely slow even after I upgraded to
            4 GB memory! <br/> What to do? (This question is a bit dramatized by the FAQ author)</p>
        <p><b>A:</b>
            <br/> Yes, checking such a project takes some time and memory resources. <br/> You
            should try to decrease the number of files that are actually checked by using <a
                href="advanced_file_sets.html">file sets</a> and <a href="advanced_filters.html"
                >filter</a> .</p>
