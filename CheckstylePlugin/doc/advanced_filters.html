        <h2>Using the plug-in filters</h2>
<p>The Eclipse Checkstyle Plug-in contains a filter facility that uses filters to exclude certain files from checking. <br />
        Knowing that the plug-in allows you to configure file sets you might ask why there are also filters. <br />
        This feature seems to be quite redundant to file sets.</p>
<p>Lets think about this some more. <br />
        File set let you configure patterns that determine if a file gets included or excluded from the checks based on the
            file name. <br />
        In some situations this is quite sufficient but there are also cases where you want to exclude files based on other
        properties, for instance if you want to exclude files that are write protected. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
<p>The filters are accessible in the bottom section of the Checkstyle Project Properties Page.</p>
<p><img src="images/properties_simple_checked.png" alt="Plug-in filters" />
        <br />
        To enable a filter for your project just select the corresponding check box. <br />
        Some filters are configurable, if you select such a filter the <i>Change...</i> button will become enabled. <br />
        Pressing the <i>Change...</i> button will open a specific filter editor.</p>
<p>The following filters come with the Checkstyle Plug-in:</p>
<ul>
            <li>
            	<p><b>File types filter</b>
            	<br/>
            	At the top of the list of filters is the File types filter. This filter exludes all files which file type
            	is not included in the configured set. Per default setting only .java files pass this filter.
            	<br/>
            	One might rightfully ask why this filter exists where you can achieve the very same using <a href="advanced_file_sets.html">file sets</a>.
            	The answer is simple: performance.
            	<br/>
            	Consider you are using the Checkstyle Plugin with a project that contains several 10,000 files. 
            	Using only file sets all files (the full project relative path) of the project would be checked against possibly multiple
            	regular expressions. The worst case is that 100,000 or more regular expression checks would be executed to determine if a file
            	needs to be checked or not.
            	<br/>
            	In comparison the file types filter performs a simple String comparison with the file ending of each file - this way the amount of files
            	that need to be checked against the file set are rapidly reduced.
            	<br/>
            	For this very reason this filter cannot be disabled.
            	<br/>
            	In most cases you won't need to change the settings of this filter. If your java files don't have the standard .java file type
            	or you are using the Checkstyle plugin with Checkstyle extensions for other languages (for instance <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/checkstyle4ada">Checkstyle4Ada</a>)
            	you can add more file types that need to pass this filter by pressing the <i>Change...</i> button.</p>
</li>
			<li>          
                <p><b>Filter for write protected files</b>
                <br />
                    Use this filter if you want to check only writeable files. This filter is particular useful if you use
                    a versioning system with a Check-In/Check-Out semantic which uses file write protection to allow/disallow
                    modification. <br />
                    So you can restrict the Checkstyle Plug-in to only check files you are actually working on (because you
                    checked them out from the repository).</p>
</li>
<li>
                <p><b>Filter for files that are not opened in an Eclipse editor</b>
                <br />
            You can use this filter to check only files you opened in an Eclipse editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
                <p><b>Filter for files from specific packages</b>
                <br />
            This is a configurable filter, allowing you to specify the packages you want to exclude from checking. You can,
            of course, get the same result by
            <a href="advanced_file_sets.html">configuring file
                sets</a>
            .</p>
</li>
<li>
                <p><b>Filter for files from non source directories</b>
                <br />
            Some projects have java sources outside of source folders (for instance build folders where all sources are copied
            to for source distribution builds). <br />
            With this filter you can exclude this files from the checks. Again, this can be also achieved by
            <a
                href="advanced_file_sets.html">configuring file sets</a>
            - but for most cases the filter is easier to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
                <p><b>Filter that excludes all files that are in sync with the CVS repository</b>
                <br />
            If your project is based on a CVS repository you might want to use this filter. <br />
            With this you can limit the checks to the files you actually changed. All other files that are in sync with the
            repository (therefore unchanged) are excluded from the checks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Eclipse Checkstyle Plug-in filters are base on some very simple interfaces - so the filter facility is very much extensible. <br />
        The plug-in provides an extension point for filters that can be used to provide your custom filter. Read
