        <h2>Important information for Rational Application Developer (RAD) 6/7 users</h2>
        <p>Due to a bug in IBMs J9 VM on which RAD runs, out of the box usage of the Eclipse
            Checkstyle Plugin will with almost certainty lead to crashes of RAD.</p>
        <p>The problem is acknowledged by IBM, considering this <a
                href="http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2044&amp;context=SSCM72&amp;dc=DB520&amp;uid=swg21256946&amp;loc=en_US&amp;cs=UTF-8&amp;lang=en&amp;rss=ct2044rational"
                >technote</a>.<br/>However, even as there is a official bug report open at IBM since
            July 2006 this problem has not been fixed yet, although the above mentioned technote
            seems to point at a specific problem location.</p>
        <p>Luckily there are two options to work around the VM crash issues:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Disable the plugins project classloader:</b>
                    <br/>Go to Window->Preferences->Checkstyle and tick the <em>Disable project
                        classloader</em> checkbox.<br/>
                    <b>Important: </b><br/>It is absolutely crucial to do a minor change to your
                    Checkstyle configuration.<br/>There are currently two checks in Checkstyle which
                    load class information of the code to be checked.<br/>Those two checks are
                        <b>JavadocMethod</b> and <b>RedundantThrows</b>.<br/>Both checks have a
                    setting called <b>logLoadErrors</b>, which must be set to
                    <em>true</em>.<br/>Failure to do so will result in Checkstyle throwing
                    RuntimeException on the attempted classloading. These RuntimeExceptions manifest
                    themselves in the plugin as error markes in the checked source files, all with a
                    problem description like: Unable to find class information for XYZ.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><b>Disable J9s class garbage collection:</b><br/>As suggested in the <a
                        href="http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2044&amp;context=SSCM72&amp;dc=DB520&amp;uid=swg21256946&amp;loc=en_US&amp;cs=UTF-8&amp;lang=en&amp;rss=ct2044rational"
                        >technote</a> it is possible to disable J9s class data garbage collection,
                    using the <b>-Xnoclassgc</b> option in rational.ini, which is placed in RADs
                    installation folder.<br/>With this option the project classloader <b>does
                    not</b> need to be disabled. The downside however is that RAD accumulates more
                    memory and might run into OutOfMemory errors more often (avg. once per work day
                    - this is my personal experience, mileage my vary).<br/>TODO: add rational.ini
                    sample</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you have strong ties to IBM or a nice and shiny support contract, please help us get
            this problem fixed once and for all. Please lobby your IBM contact person or product
            support to fix the VM bug.<br/>Thank you!</p>
