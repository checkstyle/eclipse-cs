each subsequence of the input sequence that matches such a group is saved.\n\
The captured subsequence i may be used later in the expression, via a back reference "\\i",\n\
and may also be used in the replace string via "$i".\n\

Note: Groups beginning with (? are pure, non-capturing groups that\n\
do not capture text and do not count towards the group total.

The expression "\\Qnew int[] {42}\\E;" matches text "new int[] {42}".
displayString_bs_E= \\E - End quoting
additionalInfo_bs_E= End quoting\n\n\
All characters between \\Q and the next \\E are taken literally and are not interpreted.\n\nExample:\n\

#Flags:
displayString_flag= (?ismd-ismd) - Turn flags on or off
additionalInfo_flag= Turn flags on and off for the rest of the matching process.\n\n\
Flags before the dash are turned on; those after the dash are turned off.\n\
The following flags are supported:\n\
- i: case-insensitive matching\n\
\n\
- s: single-line, or dotall matching mode:\n\
\        The expression . matches any character, including a line terminator.\n\
\n\
- m: multiline matching mode:\n\
\        The expressions ^ and $ match just after or just before,\n\
\        respectively, a line terminator or the end of the input sequence.\n\
\        By default these expressions only match at the beginning and the\n\
\        end of the entire input sequence.\n\
\n\
- d: Unix lines matching mode:\n\
\        Only the '\\n' line terminator\n\
\        is recognized in the behavior of ., ^, and $
# - u: unicode-aware case folding:\n\
#        Case-insensitive matching, when enabled, is done in a manner consistent\n\
#        with the Unicode Standard. By default, case-insensitive matching\n\
#        assumes that only characters in the US-ASCII charset are being matched.
# - c: canonical equivalence\n\
#        Two characters will be considered to match if, and only if, their full\n\
#        canonical decompositions match. The expression "a\\\u0075030A", for example,\n\
#        will match the string "a\u030A" when this flag is specified.\n\
#        By default, matching does not take canonical equivalence into account.
# - x: comments mode\n\
#        Whitespace is ignored, and embedded comments starting with\n\
#        # are ignored until the end of a line.\n\

displayString_flagExpr= (?ismd-ismd:Expr) - Turn flags on or off in Expr
additionalInfo_flagExpr= Turn flags on and off in Expr.\n\n\

\n\
- d: Unix lines matching mode:\n\
