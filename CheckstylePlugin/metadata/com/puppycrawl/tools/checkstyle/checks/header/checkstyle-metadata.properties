Headers.group = Headers

CrossLanguageRegexpHeader.charset        = name of the file charset
CrossLanguageRegexpHeader.desc           = Checks the header of each source file against a header that contains a regular expression for each line of the source header.<br/><br/>\r\nThis check is very similar to the RegexpHeader check above. However it has Checker as it's parent module, so it is not limited to java source code, and allows checking headers of other file types as well.<br/><br/>\r\nDifferent programming languages have different comment synatx rules, but all of them start a comment with a non-word character. Hence you can often use the non-word character class to abstract away the concrete comment syntax and allow checking the header for different languages with a single header definition. For example, consider the following header specification (note that this is not the full Apache licence header):\r\n<pre>\r\nline 1: ^#!\r\nline 2: ^<\\?xml.*>$\r\nline 3: ^\\W*$\r\nline 4: ^\\W*Copyright 2006 The Apache Software Foundation or its licensors, as applicable\\.$\r\nline 5: ^\\W*Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2\\.0 \\(the "License"\\);$\r\nline 6: ^\\W*$\r\n</pre>\r\nLines 1 and 2 leave room for technical header lines, e.g. the "#!/bin/sh" line in Unix shell scripts, or the xml file header of XML files. Set the multiline property to "1, 2" so these lines can be ignored for file types where they do no apply. Lines 3 throgh 6 define the actual header content. Note how lines 2, 4 and 5 use escapes for characters that have special regexp semantics. 
CrossLanguageRegexpHeader.fileExtensions = file type extensions to identify the file types to check. Must only contain text files, not binary files like bitmap graphics.
CrossLanguageRegexpHeader.header         = the required header specified inline. Individual header lines must be separated by the string "\r\n" (even on platforms with a different line separator), and regular expressions must not span multiple lines.
CrossLanguageRegexpHeader.headerFile     = name of the file containing the required header.
CrossLanguageRegexpHeader.multiLines     = line numbers to repeat (zero or more times)
CrossLanguageRegexpHeader.name           = Cross Language Regexp Header

Header.desc        = Checks that a source file begins with a specified header. Property  headerFile specifies a file that contains the required header. Alternatively, the header specification can be set directly in the <code>header</code> property without the need for an external file.<br/><br/>\r\nProperty <code>ignoreLines</code> specifies the line numbers to ignore when matching lines in a header file. This property is very useful for supporting headers that contain copyright dates. For example, consider the following header:\r\n<pre>\r\nline 1: ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\nline 2: // checkstyle:\r\nline 3: // Checks Java source code for adherence to a set of rules.\r\nline 4: // Copyright (C) 2002  Oliver Burn\r\nline 5: ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n</pre>\r\nSince the year information will change over time, you can tell Checkstyle to ignore line 4 by setting property <code>ignoreLines</code> to 4. 
Header.header      = the required header specified inline. Individual header lines must be separated by the string "\\\\n" (even on platforms with a different line separator).
Header.headerFile  = name of the file containing the required header.
Header.ignoreLines = line numbers to ignore (comma separated)
Header.name        = Header

RegexpHeader.desc       = Checks the header of a java source file against a header that contains a regular expression for each line of the source header.<br/>\r\nRationale: In some projects checking against a fixed header is not sufficient, e.g. the header might require a copyright line where the year information is not static.<br/>\r\nFor example, consider the following header:\r\n<pre>\r\nline  1: ^/{71}$\r\nline  2: ^// checkstyle:$\r\nline  3: ^// Checks Java source code for adherence to a set of rules\\.$\r\nline  4: ^// Copyright \\(C\\) \\d\\d\\d\\d  Oliver Burn$\r\nline  5: ^// Last modification by \\$Author.*\\$$\r\nline  6: ^/{71}$\r\nline  7:\r\nline  8: ^package\r\nline  9:\r\nline 10: ^import\r\nline 11:\r\nline 12: ^/\\*\\*\r\nline 13: ^ \\*([^/]|$)\r\nline 14: ^ \\*/\r\n</pre>\r\nLines 1 and 6 demonstrate a more compact notation for 71 '/' characters. Line 4 enforces that the copyright notice includes a four digit year. Line 5 is an example how to enforce revision control keywords in a file header. Lines 12-14 is a template for javadoc (line 13 is so complicated to remove conflict with and of javadoc comment). 
RegexpHeader.header     = the required header specified inline. Individual header lines must be separated by the string "\\\\n" (even on platforms with a different line separator), and regular expressions must not span multiple lines.
RegexpHeader.headerFile = name of the file containing the required header.
RegexpHeader.multiLines = line numbers to repeat (zero or more times)
RegexpHeader.name       = Regular Expression Header
