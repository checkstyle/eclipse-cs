    <p> Updates the Checkstyle core version to 6.2</p>
    <p>Please note that as of this version <strong>Java 7 is the minimum runtime environment</strong> supported. This
        requires you to run Eclipse on a Java 7 (or newer) JVM in order to use this plugin version.</p>
    <p>This restriction does not affect the ability to analyze Java 5 or lower level source code.</p>
    <p>Please further note that with Checkstyle 6.2 the <code>StrictDuplicate</code> and <code>RedundantThrows</code>
        check have been removed without replacement.<br/> Also the configuration option <code>ignoreDirectoryName</code>
        of the <code>PackageDeclaration</code> checks has been removed.<br/>If your Checkstyle configuration uses one of
        those checks/options adaptations will be required in order to use your configuration with this
        version.<br/>Please read the <a target="_blank" href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/releasenotes.html"
            >Checkstyle release notes</a> for details.</p>
