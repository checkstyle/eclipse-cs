    <p>Updates the Checkstyle core to version 8.15.</p>
    <p>
        Please note that this version requires
        <strong>Java 8 as the minimum runtime environment</strong>
        . This requires
        you to run Eclipse on a Java 8 JVM in order to use this plugin version.
    </p>
    <p>This restriction does not affect the ability to analyze Java 5 or lower level source code.</p>
