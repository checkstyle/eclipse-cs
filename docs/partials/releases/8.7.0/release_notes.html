    <p>Updates the Checkstyle core to version 8.7.</p>
    <p>
        Please note that this version requires
        <strong>Java 8 as the minimum runtime environment</strong>
        . This requires
        you to run Eclipse on a Java 8 JVM in order to use this plugin version.
    </p>
    <p>This restriction does not affect the ability to analyze Java 5 or lower level source code.</p>
    <p>
        Please read the
        <a target="_blank" href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/releasenotes.html">Checkstyle
            release notes
        </a>
        for details on recent and potentially breaking changes in Checkstyle.
        Checkstyle configuration files potentially
        need to be adapted to this version.

        The slow rate of recent updates is owed to a shift in personal interest and how I spend my spare
        time.
        <p>
            If you want to help keep this project afloat and steadily updated please send me a message or
            <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/eclipse-cs/discussion/274376/thread/3b44a5eb/">post to the
                forums
            </a>
            .
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally activity has started to migrate the project to Github (
            <a href="https://github.com/checkstyle/eclipse-cs">eclipse-cs Github page</a>
            ), hoping this will make it easier for contributions.
            Code and issue tracking have already been moved, other facilities will
            follow over the course of the next weeks.
