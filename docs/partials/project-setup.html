    <h1>Setting up a project</h1>
    <p>To get your files checked by Checkstyle there are a few simple steps set up the Checkstyle plug-in for your
        project.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Open the properties of the project you want to get checked</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="images/open_properties.png" alt="Open Project Properties"/>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Select the Checkstyle section within the properties dialog</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="images/properties_simple.png" alt="Select Checkstyle Properties"/>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Activate Checkstyle for your project by selecting the</b>
                <i>Checkstyle active for this project</i>
                <b>check box and press</b>
                <i>OK</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="images/properties_simple_checked.png" alt="Checkstyle Properties page"/>
            </p>
            <p>Don&#39;t mind the other options of the Checkstyle project configuration for now - these will be
                explained in detail later. <br/> For starters we are using the <i>Sun Checks</i> configuration which is
                built into the plug-in. This configuration contains coding conventions recommended by Sun and widely
                accepted standards and best practices. <br/>
                <br/> Now Checkstyle should begin checking your code. This may take a while depending on how many source
                files your project contains. <br/> The Checkstyle Plug-in uses background jobs to do its work - so while
                Checkstyle audits your source files you should be able to continue your work.</p>
            <p>After Checkstyle has finished checking your code please look into your Eclipse Problems View. <br/> The
                should be some warnings from Checkstyle. This warnings point to the code locations where your code
                violates the Sun Checks configuration.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="images/annotations.png"
                    alt="Checkstyle markers in Problems View and
                        source annotations"/>
            </p>
            <p>You can navigate to the problems in your code by double-clicking the problem in you problems view. <br/>
                On the left hand side of the editor an icon is shown for each line that contains a Checkstyle violation.
                Hovering with your mouse above this icon will show you the problem message. <br/> Also note the editor
                annotations - they are there to make it even easier to see where the problems are. <br/>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

        <h3>Congratulations!</h3>
        <p>You audited your first eclipse project with Checkstyle. <br/> Now you surely want to know how to change the
            rules for the audit to accommodate your own (or your companies) coding style. <br/> Read on in the <a
